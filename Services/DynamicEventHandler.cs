 * Events are more than just a convenient way of calling into all the registered dependencies. Actually calls to event 
 * go through the so-called Orchard Event Bus (see: http://docs.orchardcore.net/projects/O1/en/latest/Documentation/How-Orchard-works#EventBus). 
 * A method call is not just a simple method call but really a message broadcasted on the event bus. This makes it 
 * possible such crazy things like handling an event without having a reference to it!

     * This is not very useful here as the event handler interface is in the same module, but imagine a scenario where 
     * the event handler interfaces are in a separate module. Now in your own module you could reference that other 
     * module - but you don't have to! Using the pattern described here you can handle event that are raised from a module 
     * you don't even have a reference for! Such very loose coupling is useful e.g. if you don't want to force the users 
     * of your module to install your module's dependency: one of your module's feature can hook into the other module 
     * and thus depend on it but if the user doesn't want to use that feature it's not mandatory for her/him to install 
     * that other module (in contrary to having a .NET project reference).
