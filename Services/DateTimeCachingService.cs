        //      web farm) setup. ICacheService resides in the Orchard.Caching module so your module should depend on it
        //      (like this one). This cache can react on memory pressure (i.e. it can throw away items if free memory is
        //      low).

        //      won't deal with memory pressure, i.e. items will be kept in the cache even if free memory is low. Both
        // services are tenant-specific, i.e. if you cache something you'll only be able to access it from the same
        // tenant (see https://docs.orchardcore.net/projects/O1/en/latest/Documentation/Setting-up-a-multi-tenant-Orchard-site/ for
