Description: Demo Orchard module for training purposes. Based on Sipke Schoorstra's Orchard Harvest session (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH9mcodTX-U).
Features:
    OrchardHUN.TrainingDemo:
        Name: Training Demo
        Category: Demo
        Description: This is the base feature of the module: it has the same name as the module itself. We'll use this first.
        Dependencies: Orchard.Resources, Orchard.Caching
    OrchardHUN.TrainingDemo.Contents:
        Name: Training Demo Contents
        Category: Demo
        Description: This is a second feature of the module: it contains some content managegement-related code. As you can see it depends on the base feature (as it uses some of its services) and on the built-in Widgets and Autoroute module (more precisely: on the Orchard.Widgets and Orchard.Autoroute feature). All in all it's good practice for a subfeature to depend on the root feature as normally you'd write all common code in the root feature.
        Dependencies: OrchardHUN.TrainingDemo, Orchard.Widgets, Orchard.Autoroute
