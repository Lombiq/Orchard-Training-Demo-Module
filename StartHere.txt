Hi there!


Good to see you want to learn the ins and outs of Orchard module creation. Reading code is always a good way for this!

We'll guide you on your journey to become an Orchard developer. Look for "NEXT STATION" comments in the code to see where
to head next, otherwise look throught the code as you like.

Before you dive deep into this module it'd be best if you made sure that you have done the following:
*	You know what MVC is about and how ASP.NET MVC works. It's important that you understand how ASP.NET MVC works or 
	generally what MVC is about. If you are not familiar with the topic take a look at the tutorials at http://www.asp.net/mvc.
	Or for a funnier start, watch this video: http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/matthijs/ASPNET-MVC-2-Basics-Introduction-by-Scott-Hanselman
*	You've read through the documentation at http://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/ (at least the "Getting Started", "About
	the project" and "Developer Tools and Guidelines" sections, but it would be great if you'd read the whole documentation).
*	You know Orchard from a user's perspecive and understand the concepts underlying the system.

We've invested a lot of time creating this module. If you have ideas regarding it or have found mistakes, please let us
know on the project page: https://github.com/Lombiq/Orchard-Training-Demo-Module

If you'd like to get trained instead of self-learning or you need help in form of mentoring sessions take a look at Orchard 
Dojo's  trainings: https://orcharddojo.net/orchard-training

Although the module has no function apart from serving as a demonstration we've written everything in a way that it really
runs and you can try it out in action. Just download the latest source of Orchard (https://github.com/OrchardCMS/Orchard/),
add this module is in the OrchardHUN.TrainingDemo folder under the Modules directory, open the solution and add the 
module's project to it. Don't forget to run the solution in Debug mode and break into the code to be able to look into
some specific details!

After you complete this tutorial (or even during walking through it) you're encouraged to look at the built-in modules 
how they solve similar tasks. You have the whole Orchard source at your hands: let it be your tutor :-).

Later on, you may want to take a look at Map.cs (remember, "X marks the spot!") in the project root for
reminders regarding specific solutions, structured along the "Module development and Orchard APIs" section of the
training guidelines on Orchard Dojo (https://orcharddojo.net/orchard-resources/Library/Training/Guidelines/).

Head over to Module.txt. That file is the module's manifest; a Module.txt is required for Orchard modules. For more info 
see: https://docs.orchardcore.net/projects/O1/en/latest/Documentation/Manifest-files/


This demo is heavily inspired by Sipke Schoorstra's Orchard Harvest session (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MH9mcodTX-U) 
and brought to you by the Orchard Hungary team (http://english.orchardproject.hu/) and Lombiq (https://lombiq.com/).

This module was created with the code generation tool and the "codegen module OrchardHUN.TrainingDemo" command. For more
