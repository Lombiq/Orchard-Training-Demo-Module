/* What you're now looking at is an extension point for the available filters in this Orchard application.
 * Filters in Orchard work based on MVC's filters, so please read the short tutorial available at
 * https://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/older-versions/controllers-and-routing/understanding-action-filters-cs if you're not 
 * yet familiar with the basic concept.
 * 
 * "Fast forwarding Memory to a more recent one."
 * 
 * As you now know, filters in MVC are implementations of one of the four basic filter interfaces (IActionFilter, 
 * IAuthorizationFilter, IResultFilter, IExceptionFilter) and can be applied to actions using attributes. You can stick 
 * with that, but Orchard provides a little addition to that. If your filter class inherits from FilterProvider, your 
 * filter will be applied to every request (so you don't have to add attributes to any action for the filter to be 
 * applied), but you have to perform a check in the filter's method(s) to determine whether it's necessary to run the 
 * code in the given method, e.g. by checking a condition related to the context.
