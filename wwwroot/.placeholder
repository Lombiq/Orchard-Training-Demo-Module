This file is necessary to be able to commit the wwwroot folder into source control while having the rest of it excluded.
This in turn is required to allow Gulp-built static assets to be accessible when first starting the app during 
development after a fresh build, instead of letting Gulp create the folder but the static file serving pipeline not 
recognizing the new folder.
