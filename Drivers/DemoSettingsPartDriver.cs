/*
 * Really nothing special in this driver. BUT! If we'd like to have this editor under a different editor group than the 
 * default one (i.e. we'd like to display the editor not under Settings/General but Settings/Something else) then it 
 * changes which edito builds the shape!
 * So if you use editor groups (see editor groups samples here: https://orcharddojo.net/orchard-resources/Library/Examples/) 
 * make sure to employ the technique of building the shape from the second Editor() method, and checking the updater for 
 * null inside (as shown in the samples).
 *
 * NEXT STATION: after you've enjoyed looking head over to EditorTemplates/Parts.DemoSettings
