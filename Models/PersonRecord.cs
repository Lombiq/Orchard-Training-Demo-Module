/*
 * Now we'll get to know how low-level DB data storage works. For this we'll create a simple record class and use it to 
 * store a person's data in a DB table.
 * We use such low-level storage if we want to store something in the DB what we don't want to use as part of content 
 * items. This includes data that e.g. our module uses internally and we don't really want to expose to the outside world.
 * Make sure to read the corresponding documentation (http://docs.orchardcore.net/projects/O1/en/latest/Documentation/Understanding-data-access) 
 * first!
