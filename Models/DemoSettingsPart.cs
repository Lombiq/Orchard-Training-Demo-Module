 * We'll now add some settings to the dashboard (see: https://docs.orchardcore.net/projects/O1/en/latest/Documentation/Modifying-site-settings).
 * As pretty much everthing that counts, site settings are also content items in Orchard. More precisely, the site 
 * settings is a single content item of type Site. By adding a content part to this Site content type we can extend site 
 * settings.
 * 
 * Site settings start off with a standard content part. These parts are under the Contents feature.
