/*
 * This is a controller you can find in any ASP.NET Core MVC application; Orchard is an MVC application, although
 * much-much more than that.
 *
 * An Orchard module is basically an MVC area. You could create areas that don't interact with Orchard and you'd just
 * use standard ASP.NET Core MVC skills. Of course we want more than that, so let's take a closer look.
 *
 * Here you will see how to use some simple ASP.NET Core and Orchard Core services.
