/*
 * There are multiple ways to cache data in ASP.NET Core which are used in Orchard Core as well. For example the
 * content items are cached using the IMemoryCache service. In-memory caching holds the copy of data in local serverâ€™s
 * memory which could be enough in most cases. Some features, however, require some extra functionality and more
 * complex ways of caching such as shapes. In Orchard Core there is a so-called Dynamic Cache which is built upon the
 * Distributed Cache. Distributed cache maintains cache in a centralized location which is accessible by servers in a
 * cluster. In Orchard Core this is also memory cache but opens up the possibility to use Redis for example. In this
 * tutorial we will see a couple of examples of caching a DateTime object and shape caching will also be demonstrated.
