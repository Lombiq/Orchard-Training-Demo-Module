/*
 * Another pretty simple controller, but here we get to know how dependency injection works within Orchard. If you're
 * not yet familiar with DI make sure to study the concept first: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection.
 * 
 * Orchard gives us built-in constructor injection for dependencies. This means that if you request a dependency by its 
 * interface in your class's constructor, Orchard will automatically inject an active implementation for you.
 * 
 * In the form of ILogger and Localizer we also get to know two exceptions.
