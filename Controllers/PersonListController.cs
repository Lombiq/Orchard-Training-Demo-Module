/*
 * In this controller you will see again how to query items but this time items will be of the newly created Person
 * content type. It doesn't make too much difference but you need to keep in mind that the ContentItems are stored in
 * the documents (which contain the parts and fields serialized) and can have multiple index records referencing a
 * content item (e.g. the previously created PersonPartIndex that indexes data in from PersonPart).
 *
 * Note that there is no custom controller or action demonstrated for displaying the editor for the Person. Go to the
 * administration page (/Admin) and create a few Person content items, including ones with ages above 30.
