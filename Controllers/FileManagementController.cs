         * There are several services in Ochard that provide an abstraction to file system access. You should generally 
         * use these instead of directly accessing the file system through the .NET libraries as because of the variety
         * of hosting services direct file access is not always possible (e.g. media files can be outsourced to an 
         * external storage provider like an Amazon cloud service or an Azure Blob Storage: you can't access files stored 
         * there directly); these services however give you a consistent API, regardless of the implementation.
         * 
         * Orchard file system access services:
         * *    IStorageProvider: we'll use this here as this is the most important probably. With this service you can 
         *      access files stored in the Media folder of the tenant (each tenant has its own folder in the Media 
         *      directory). The Media directory is accessible to anyone!
         *      Also keep in mind that the Media folder's content is accessible from the dashboard through the Media module
         *      (http://docs.orchardcore.net/projects/O1/en/latest/Documentation/Adding-and-managing-media-content) so your users are able 
         *      to directly access them.
         *      However a hidden, "technical" media folder is under consideration.
         * *    IMediaService: a higher level service to access the Media folder as well, but it also contains additional 
         *      functionality to lower-level file access e.g. for handling uploaded files. It also honours the settings 
         *      configured under Media settings on the dashboard.
         * *    IVirtualPathProvider: this is the service for accessing files outside the Media folder, like any file in 
         *      modules' directories.
         *      Use this only if you want to have the lowest level file access that most likely corresponds to the local 
         *      file system (in contrary to the two other services that, as mentioned, can point to external file systems).
