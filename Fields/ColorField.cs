/*
 * Now we will develop a content field. Just like with content part development, we'll start by creating a model class.
 * We want to store a color name and the actual color in HEX so we need two strings for that. To test this please
 * attach this field for a content part or a content type (you can create new ones if you want) on the Dashboard.
 *
 * Conventionally we put these objects in the Fields folder.
 *
 * To learn more about content fields see:
 * https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/dev/docs/reference/modules/ContentFields/

// Don't forget to register your content field and the related view models in the Startup.cs static constructor so these
// will be accessible in the Liquid markup.
