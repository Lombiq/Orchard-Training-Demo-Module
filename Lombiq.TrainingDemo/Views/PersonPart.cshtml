@model PersonPartViewModel
@* Not much interesting happening here, we just display data from the view model. Note that there's no need to display
    anything from the Biography Text Field: The field has its own display already defined so it'll handle it for
    itself. However, we could retrieve and display data from it here by accessing it via the
    Model.PersonPart.Biography.Text property (though at that point it would be nicer to put a Biography property
    directly on to the view model) *@

<div><strong>@Model.Name</strong></div>
<div>@T["Birth Date: {0}", Model.BirthDateUtc?.ToShortDateString()]</div>
<div>@T["Handedness: {0}", Model.Handedness]</div>
