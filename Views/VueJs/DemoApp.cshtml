@*Here a demo Vue.js application will be initialized. Right below you can see a script inclusion app which is the
    bundled Vue.js application (we will see it real soon).*@

<script asp-name="Lombiq.TrainingDemo.DemoApp" at="Head"></script>

@*This shape renders the template of the Vue.js component. If you have multiple templates then render them here
    one-by-one. We'll see how it looks like when we get to our Vue component script file.*@
<shape type="VueComponent-Demo_Component"></shape>

@*This is the container of the demo app.*@
<div id="demoApp">
    @*Everything inside this container is processed by Vue. This one here will tell Vue to render the demo
        component.*@
    <demo-component></demo-component>
</div>

@*And finally the initialization. We'd like to pass an options object from here which is tricky since our Vue.js
    application is written using ES6 modules. One way to work around this is to expose an initialization function on the
    window object where we can inject our application options. These options could contain localized texts (assuming that
    you want to localize text only in Orchard Core) and other data like the anti-forgery token if you have forms.*@

<script at="Foot">
    window.initDemoApp({
        element: '#demoApp',
        @*Notice that this text is localized.*@
        text: '@T["Hi there!"]'
    });
</script>
