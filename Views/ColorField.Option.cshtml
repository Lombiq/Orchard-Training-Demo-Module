@* You can create custom editor options for a field which is very similar to creating custom shapes from the driver,
    however, this way you don't need to write any C# code to achieve this so you can implement them in any theme even
    if it contains only Liquid markup.

    Let's say you want to have a HEX editor (default) and a color picker editor for the ColorField. Then you need to
    create an option shape and the editor shape to each editor options. The default editor shape is already created
    (ColorField.Edit.cshtml) and this file is the option shape. For all the other editor options you need to create the
    shapes with this pattern: [FieldName]-[OptionName].Option.cshtml and [FieldName]-[OptionName].Edit.cshtml.

    For detailed documentation see:
    https://docs.orchardcore.net/en/latest/docs/reference/modules/ContentFields/#creating-custom-editors

@{
    string currentEditor = Model.Editor;
}

@* These options will actually be options in the markup on the Dashboard on the content definition editor. This is a
    default option with no value. We gave the name Hexadecimal. The ColorField.Edit.cshtml will be applied as the
    default editor shape. *@

<option value="" selected="@(string.IsNullOrEmpty(currentEditor))">@T["Hexadecimal"]</option>
