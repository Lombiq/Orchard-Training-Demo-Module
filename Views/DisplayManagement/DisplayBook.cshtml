@* We passed the generated display shape object to this view. To actually render any shapes generated in Orchard we use
    Display helpers. To use these Orchard Core-related helpers in any .cshtml files we need to add a few usings and tag
    helpers to a _ViewImports.cshtml file.*@

@await DisplayAsync(Model)

@* NEXT STATION: Go to Views/_ViewImports.cshtml *@
