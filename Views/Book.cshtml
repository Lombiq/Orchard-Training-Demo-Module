@* This is the display shape of any Book item if no display type is given (actually the default display type is
"Detail"). This is generated by Orchard Core and the model contains all the zones defined in any DisplayDrivers where
the zones will contain the rendered smaller shapes you've seen earlier. *@

<div class="book">
    @* Display Cover zone if there is any shape placed in the zone. *@
    @if (Model.Cover != null)
    {
        <div class="bookCover">
            @await DisplayAsync(Model.Cover)
        </div>
    }

    @* Display Header zone if there is any shape placed in the zone. *@
    @if (Model.Header != null)
    {
        <header class="bookHeader">
            @await DisplayAsync(Model.Header)
        </header>
    }

    <a asp-action="DisplayBookDescription" asp-area="Lombiq.TrainingDemo" class="viewBookDescriptionLink">@T["View Description"]</a>
</div>

@* Now create another display type for the Book where the Description will be rendered.
NEXT STATION: Go back to Controllers/DisplayManagementController.cs and find the DisplayBookDescription action. *@
