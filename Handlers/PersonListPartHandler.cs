         * Injecting necessary dependencies.
         * 
         * Notice Work<T>. This construct is used to lazily inject dependencies. This means that a dependency injected 
         * with Work<T> (here IPersonManager) won't get resolved until it is really needed (i.e. when accessing the 
         * Work object's Value property). Also, Work<T> uses a different dependency lifetime scope than the scope of 
         * the request (hence the name: the scope's name is "work"). This makes it possible to resolve dependencies not 
         * just from the scope the class requesting them (e.g. an ISingletonDependency belongs to the "shell" scope but 
         * you can use IDependency types from it through Work<T>).
         * However most possibly you will only need Work<T> for lazy resolving (what can have a positive performance 
         * impact).
         * 
         * If just lazy injection is needed (i.e. only to resolve a dependency when really needed) you could also inject 
         * Lazy<T> and user it in the same way as Work<T>.
